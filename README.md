# Digits_Recognition_CNN-Algorithm

Digit Recognition using CNN Algorithm
Introduction
The Digit Recognition using CNN Algorithm project is designed to identify handwritten digits (0–9) with high accuracy. Leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this project efficiently processes image data and performs digit classification. The widely-known MNIST dataset is used for training and testing the model.

# Features:
Automatic Dataset Loading: The MNIST dataset is automatically downloaded and preprocessed.
Robust CNN Architecture: Carefully designed layers to capture and analyze image features.
Visualization: Graphs for training loss, accuracy trends, and test results.
Prediction Demo: Allows real-time testing of digit recognition with custom inputs.
Model Checkpointing: Saves the best-performing model for later use.

# Prerequisites:

Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding:

Python 3.x \
TensorFlow or Keras \
NumPy \
Matplotlib \
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive development) 

# Model Architecture:
Input Layer: Accepts 28x28 grayscale images.\
Convolutional Layers: Extract spatial features from the images.\
Pooling Layers: Reduce the feature map size while retaining important information.\
Fully Connected Layers: Map the features into class probabilities.\

# Dataset Details
The MNIST Dataset is a collection of 70,000 labeled images of handwritten digits. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image, and the digits range from 0 to 9. The dataset is split into:

Training Set: 60,000 images.

Test Set: 10,000 images.

# How the Model Works:

Data Preprocessing:\
Normalizes image pixel values to a [0, 1] range.\
Reshapes each image to add a channel dimension for compatibility with CNNs.

# CNN Architecture:

Input Layer: Accepts 28x28 images.

Convolutional Layers: Extract spatial patterns using filters.

Pooling Layers: Downsample feature maps to reduce dimensionality.

Fully Connected Layers: Process extracted features for classification.

Output Layer: Uses softmax activation to output probabilities for each digit class (0–9).

# Training:

Uses categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

Trains over multiple epochs with validation to monitor overfitting.


# Output:
The trained model demonstrates an accuracy of approximately 98% on the MNIST test dataset. Visualization of predictions confirms its robustness in recognizing a variety of handwritten digits.
